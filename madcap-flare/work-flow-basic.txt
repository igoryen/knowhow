I am learning the MFC workflow now as well, using http://help.madcapsoftware.com/flare2017r3/Content/Flare/Introduction/Home-Flare.htm 

What I have got so far is this:

Basic Workflow

Step # 1 - File > New Project > New project >
                Project name: “blabla”
Project folder: C:\Users\flare\Documents\My Projects (not to be changed)

Step # 2 - Next > Source > New from template > Factory Templates > Online & Print > “Top Navigation and PDF Advanced”

Step # 3 - Next > Finish > see the created new project

Step # 4 - Content Explorer > Content > make your edits

Step # 5 - Project > Build Primary > (wait until the project finishes building by the progress bar at page bottom) > 

Step # 6 - Desktop > My Projects – Shortcut > blabla > Ouput > flare > Online Output > HTML5 – Top Navigation 

Step # 7 - Desktop > DUMP_HERE > delete all the files (Access Denied -> Continue) > 

Step # 8 - Copy all the files from the folder opened in Step #6 into the folder opened in Step #7

Step # 9 – Desktop > Open Chrome >  
                If necessary do this: 
-	Ctrl+Shift+R to clear the cache in the browser
-	copy-paste this URL into the address bar: localhost/Default.htm

Then you should see the online output in the web browser.



The main part now is what to do in Step #4.

Transfer files

The simplest way to transfer files from your local computer (your own computer) to the remote computer when using the Remote Desk Connection is to just copy-pasting the file. Please see the screencast I attached.

I would like to take a look at the body of information that will be put on the site to share my ideas about how to structure it and divide it.

Thank you, and standing by for more questions,
Igor
