Output/codebase types that Flare can produce
	online ~ (e.g. HTML5)
	print-based ~ (e.g. PDF and Word)

Target is
	one instance of an output type.
	i.e. one codebase

	the engine
		it takes all of your files and settings
		and brings them together to produce the end result. 

		When you build your final output, 
		you are essentially building one or more of the targets in your project.

How to add targets?

		In Flare you can add targets using any of the available formats, 
		and you can make as many copies of an ex`isting target that you want. 

		For example, 
		your project might end up containing three targets that are all based on the output type (in addition to other targets).

A target file has an .fltar extension and 
is stored in the Project Organizer under the Targets folder. 

Batch target

	a batch file
	it contains all the other target

	helps compile the output for all the targets
		you don't have to compile the output for each file separately
	with a single button "Build only"

	when done,
	Project ribbon (on top) > "View primary" > see the outputs

	each of the outputs has an individual look and feel.
