added home icon, black, home.png
built
added home icon white, replaced the black one, now have home.png only white
	an updated home.png
the old one doesn't exist anymore, but the editor still shows home.png black
	the white icon is there too, but named home_1.png

	The imbecil renames stuff for me!!!

It does things correctly only after a build.
