	3 components:
	A - webpack
	B - webpack-cli
	C - webpack-dev-server
	

	installed the vue cli into tandem
	planned to install the vue cli into the root
	the problem with the default installation
	folder A (src) has JS and CSS
	folder B (public) has HTML and images
	folder C (dist) has the bundle made by webpack

	tried to think of a way how to use this setup with the dir hierarchy of CNX
	couldn't think of anything

	a guy on the internet said
	webpack can be installed and configured manually
	started doing it manually

	webpack installation goes wrong all the time
	3 components:
	A - webpack
	B - webpack-cli
	C - webpack-dev-server
	there seems to be a combination 
	certain versions
	at which this trio can cooperate

	people on the internet suggest their versions
	but i want to have the latest

	Attempt:
	follow somebody's recommendation
	to make it work at least somehow.

	Trying this: (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40379139/cannot-find-module-webpack-bin-config-yargs) DATE: 190514
	pasted this into package.json
	"webpack": "^4.31.0",
	"html-webpack-plugin": "^3.0.0",
	"webpack-bundle-analyzer": "^3.3.2",
	"webpack-cli": "^3.3.2",
	"webpack-dev-server": "^3.3.1",
	"webpack-merge": "^4.1.0"

	A - action
	Q - question
	O - observation
	R - result

	E1: Added the above to package.json
		npm install
		webpack --version
	R: prompts installing webpack-cli
	
	I: why install webpack-cli after I ran npm install?
	
	A3: I agreed to install webpack-cli
		installation script runs ('npm install -D webpack-cli')
	
	A4: I run 'webpack --version'
	R:  It prompts me to install webpack-cli 

	O1: Webpack CLI I wanted to install: "webpack-cli": "^3.3.2",
		Webpack cli that was installed:  "webpack-cli": "^3.3.9", // higher version

	A5: repeat actons 3-4
	
	O2: infinite loop of actions 3-4 

	A6: edited package.json with the following:
		"webpack": "^3.0.0",
		"webpack-cli": "2.0.13",
		"webpack-config-utils": "2.0.0",
		"webpack-dev-server": "^2.7.1",
		"webpack-validator": "2.2.7"

	E:  npm install
	R:  warnings, 
	A:  package.json matches the above
	E:  webpack --version
	R:  asks me if I want to install webpack-cli

	E:  I say yes.
	R:  Error: Cannot find module 'webpack-cli'

	H:  webpack-cli not installed globally
	E:  npm i -g webpack-cli
	R:  npm WARN webpack-cli@3.3.9 requires a peer of webpack@4.x.x but none is installed. 
		You must install peer dependencies yourself.
	O:  My package.json has "webpack": "^3.0.0"
		`npm i -g webpack-cli` tries to install version 3.3.9
		but 3.3.9 requires webpack@4.x.x

	H:  i need to install webpack (update it to) 4.x.x
		how? 
		npm install --save-dev webpack

	E:  npm install --save-dev webpack
	R:  package.json - "webpack": "^3.12.0",
	A:  npm install --save-dev webpack installs version 3.x.x, not 4.x.x

	P:  i need to install webpack@4.x.x
	H:  npm install webpack@next webpack-cli --save-dev 
		Source: https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-4-beta-try-it-today-6b1d27d7d7e2
	E:  npm install webpack@next webpack-cli --save-dev 
	R: 	package.json
		"webpack": "^5.0.0-alpha.29",
    	"webpack-cli": "^2.1.5",
    I:  I have installed webpack@5 and its cli @2.1.5
    H:  it must know what it's doing.
    	this was intentional
    	this is a working combination
    P:  if I run webpack --version it 
    	- will show me version 
    	- will not ask me to install CLI
    E:  webpack --version
    R: 	4.41.0
    A:  this is the correct command to run:
    	npm install webpack@next webpack-cli --save-dev

    --------------------

    P: I need to run the webpack-dev-server but I don't know how
    O: package.json has object 'scripts' with prop "start"
    H: if I run `npm run start` the server will run
    E: npm run start
    R: Error: Cannot find module 'webpack/bin/config-yargs'
    	log: failed to execute the start script (webpack-dev-server)
    I: webpack-dev-server can't execute
    P: if I simply run "webpack-dev-server" in the terminal, it will fail
    E: webpack-dev-server
    R: Error: Cannot find module 'webpack/bin/config-yargs'

    I: the port number is taken by another process
    H: the port number is wrong
    P: if I change the port number it will work
    
    E: node_modules/webpack-dev-server/bin/webpack-server.js
    	old: const DEFAULT_PORT = 8080;
    	new: const DEFAULT_PORT = 8585;
    	npm run start
    R: Error: Cannot find module 'webpack/bin/config-yargs'
   	
   	E: node_modules/webpack-dev-server/bin/webpack-server.js
   		old: const DEFAULT_PORT = 8585;
   		new: const DEFAULT_PORT = 8888;
    	npm run start
    R: Error: Cannot find module 'webpack/bin/config-yargs'

    H: My npm cache is dirty
    P: If I clean it, the server will start
    E: make these in sequence:
    	npm cache clean --force
    	npm install
    	npm run start

    R: Error: Cannot find module 'webpack/bin/config-yargs'

    P: if I use a different combination, it will work
    E: using this one: https://github.com/mzgoddard/jest-webpack/issues/27#issuecomment-389130755
    	old:
    		"webpack": "^5.0.0-alpha.29",
