widgets = a library of ready-made blocks of html + css + JS

section = <section>

page template = predesigned page (html + CSS + JS)
block = predesigned <section> (html + CSS + JS)

if I add a ready template to a page
what happens?
div1
	div2
		div3
			div4

Which div is inserted?

A template is like 
	an included file?
	a collection of HTML+CSS+JS that I spill on the canvas (page) and then rearrange the way I like?


Theory:
a page is like a canvas
a template is like a look-and-feel 
when I "insert" a template into a page,
I make a copy of HTML+CSS+JS that the template has
and slop/dump/drop/spill it on to the page
and then rearrange it to my liking

WP page > "eye" (Preview)

WP page > Publish
What does it do?
"See the live page" - pushes it to Prod


-----------------------------------

"Save as template"
means
if you have created a combination of HTML+CSS+JS that you want to keep
save it as a "template"
and you will be able to make copies of it in the future.

------------


what's the difference of inserting a template
via "Insert" and
via the Template widget
?

- "Insert" dumps a copy the HTML+CSS+JS into the page
- the Template widget creates an instance of the class. 
	It is syncked to the template.
	If the template changes, they reflect everywhere that template is used via the Template widget.
