Elementor Forms:

features regarding emails

Our Marketing Dept. would like to obtain statistics re: the emails submitted from our website.

In view of the above, I would like to learn how to do the following (as is described at https://elementorforms.com/):

#1 Save Entries to Database
Save form submission to wordpress database where you can easily view and export data as CSV.

#2 Multi File Uploads
With Elementor Forms you can upload multiple files and they will be stored in database and will also be sent to the e-mail as attachment.

#3 Google Sheets
It is super easy to submit your form entries to google sheets, you can specify which fields to include.

Your help will be appreciated!
