Let's chat on Hangouts!
Hi
Yeah google never fails us 🙂
so
so now the issue with current solution is
it changes the value on the fly
so what do i do?
You have to give us this weekend, we  will try to find a way
do you need this solution for all your sites or just one?
if you need this solution for just this site we can hard code your e-mails
i wouldn't pay 400 for a form for just one site
i want it to be customizable
and used in the future
Yes for that we will be building conditional logic e-mails
i think instead of doing this
we can build a module over the weekend that would send conditional e-mails based on options selected
so you don't have to mess with select values
and simply create your logic
well, if that works...
the thing is i need to demo this, and if it doesn't work then what will i say?
No don't worry we will make it work
we will either have the conditional logic e-mail by monday or atleast what you need
so conditional e-mail but shows select value on e-mail and db 🙂
You can wait till monday right?
if we do this sooner i will let u know
please explain what the conditional logic workflow will look like
If field name select value is this then send e-mail to this e-mail
that would be neat.
and if you don't make it by monday?
We can't promise this logic by monday as it may require more testing.
but we will deliver what you requested initially
let me sum up what i have requested:
1) that the form sends an email to address user selected in a select option, and includes the description/text of the option user selected.
2) that the first option of the select be made selected but disabled. This is needed when the design doesn't use input labels, as it's in my case
My designer wants me to use only input placeholders 
these are the 2 things i need
Yes not a problem
if we include the option name/label before or after e-mail
that will do right
optionselected - email@email.com
please explain "before or after email"
you set an e-mail as a value of a select option
but that was already done in the yesterday's version
so once you receive an e-mail
yes hear me out
so once you receive an email you only get the e-mail
so you don't know what option is selected
so you don't want the e-mail to appear in the email but option that is selected
yes, this is my situation atm
is it okay if you receive e-mail and the option selected together?

This is what i get now, and i want to see the option selected included into the email
so option select - igor.yentaltsev@gmail.com
this will do?
Got it
leave it with me we will deliver it by monday
one more question
yeah

the highlighted are input names
is there a way to customize them?
field names are converted in to more readable names for E-mails and DB
you can customize the field names
if you choose first_name as field name
it will be submitted to e-mail and db as First Name
The field name should be unique for the form or for the whole site?
for the form
for each form
ok
Will you be available over the weekend to test if we do this sooner?
just a second
yes, i can do it but only in the evening your time, since you are 8 hours ahead
Yes that is fine, we will test it on our website and send you the link
so you can test it whenever you are online.
Thank you, talk to you soon then
Cheers
Hi Igor
Great News 🙂
We have done it
let me know when you are around to test.
Hi, thanks! Will you email it to me?
oh, you mean i can get it from the website?
i'll do that.
Yup
You can download the zip file from our website and use that.
Hey
So everything worked well with the conditional e-mails 🙂
Yes! Works fine! Thanks a lot!
My pleasure 🙂
I'd appreciate it if you let me know when the confirmation modal would be fixed. How long do you think I'd have to wait?
We will fix this tomorrow and push a new update 🙂
Hey awesome guys!
Was just wondering if the new update was ready yet? 
Yes
we already pushed it this morning
1.6.8
awesome! Thank you!
My pleasure 🙂
Guys, I'm having an issue with the HTML input element. It's not rendered at all. It's not even in the DOM.  


This is very odd
do you have a live link?
https://cnx.nationwideappraisals.com/contact/
no html field
how am i suppose to see?
it is not showing in frontend?
right
i added it in the Page builder
Save it, but it's not in the DOM
yes i just tested
its not showing here either
let me quickly take a look
the HTML input disappeared after i updated to 1.6.8
darn it, i accidentally replaced the logic code with render
😀
let me quickly fix it 
I remember you said you were in Dubai, OAE?
Yup
Why? 🙂
Just curious
also, i feel uneasy bothering you guys at 11pm
(i like the 23:00 format better)
Not a problem
Its always a pleasure to help 🙂
I just pushed 1.6.9
with the HTML input fix
👍
many many thanks!
My pleasure, btw i noticed you have a checkbox to subscribe to newsletter
how do you plan on using it?
The basic way: the user checks it if they want to be added on the list. The value is stored in the DB, right? The marketing here wants to query the database regularly, manually or automatically.
Ahh we already have mailpoet integration
mailpoet?
where you tick this checkbox and you are automatically subscribed
yes
its a wp newsletter thing
my experience with WP is still a little limited.
i haven't reached the WP Newsletter feature
i haven't covered it yet
will give that a read
Yeah cool
allright let me know if you need help with anything else
good luck 🙂
i'll update now
thanks a lot!!!
My pleasure :0
🙂
it works!
👍
Great 🙂
