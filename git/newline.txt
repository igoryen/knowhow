-----------------
Newline
|| line ending
|| end of line (EOL) 

this is a (sequence of) control character(s) aka non-printing character(s)

there's a close association between
line feed (LF)
and
carriage return (CR)

CR says 
"move the position of the cursor to the first position on the same line"

LF says
"move to the next line"

so CRLF says 
"move the position of the cursor to the first position on the same line"
+
"move to the next line"
= "start a new line"


Unix says LF
MS Windows says CR LF

When Git says
"Warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF"
it means
"I will replace Unix newlines with MS Windows newlines"
