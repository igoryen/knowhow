	the process of automating the creation of a software build and the associated processes including: 
	compiling computer source code into binary code, 
	packaging binary code, 
	and running automated tests.

software build:
	1) either to the process of converting source code files into standalone software artifact(s) that can be run on a computer, 
	2) or the result of doing so. 
	However, this is not the case with technologies such as Perl, Ruby or Python which are examples of interpreted languages.
