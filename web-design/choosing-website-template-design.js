Choosing the right website template design is like buying a house – confusing at times, and you’re afraid you’ll make the wrong choice.


The criteria, the key points

-------------------------
1. Content Width Design

	a. Full-width content area.

		The web site "has no bounbdaries"
		Very popular type of website layout.
		more contemporary look.
		Works very well for mobile responsive templates and graphic heavy websites.
		Wider width allows you to fit more tabs in your menu bar.
		As the background image auto adjusts to fit the screen, 
		the positioning of the content on top of the image may shift depending on the size and screen resolutions of your visitors’ computer screen. 
		Some people may find this annoying.

	b. Boxed-width content area.

		more traditional look
		The content has a visible frame to the left and right side of the screen.  So it feels like the content is “boxed” into a set area. 
		Traditional website design with a professional, business-oriented feel.
		Provides a fixed width for the content. 
		This allows the content display and position to remain relatively the same across different monitor sizes and resolutions, 
		so you don’t have worry about different people having different visual experiences
		Boxed-width design works best if you want your content display to be consistent and more predictable across all monitor sizes and resolutions.

--------------------------
2. Home Page Header Design

	It’s the section towards the top of your home page, usually the first thing your visitors will see when they visit your website.
	E.g. a design’s header can have an image and text overlaid on top of it.
	A homepage header of some sort. 
	These headers can contain static images, slideshows, or even play videos.
	Which header design you pick is a strategic decision, more so than a design decision.
	The header section needs to create awareness and understanding of what you’re all about, rather than to simply look nice.

	A. STATIC HEADER IMAGE WITH NO CONTENT

		if a single image can effectively tell the story of your brand.

		Static image header should ONLY be used in websites 
		that rely heavily on beautiful photographs to attract customers — 
		portfolio, hotel, restaurant, some physical products or graphic-intensive websites.

		If your business requires text to explain what you do and how you can help your customers, 
		relying solely on a static header image is not ideal.
		A static header image can take up a lot of valuable space “Above-The-Fold” – basically, 
		the screen area that your visitors see when they first land on your website.

		So if your business requires some text to explain who you are and what you’re all about, 
		then relying solely on a static header image (without content in the image) might leave your visitors slightly confused as to what you do.

		Relying solely on an image to communicate what your website is about might work well for businesses 
		such as restaurants, hotels, or businesses that have more to do with “lifestyle”. 
		But it doesn’t always work for a lot of other businesses.  
		For these sort of businesses, you’ll need to rely on more than just an image.

		Ask yourself this question – Is your website easily explained through a simple image without any text?  

	B. STATIC HEADER IMAGE WITH CONTENT

		If you need text headlines to explain what your business does – most common.
		Who should use this?

		All websites can benefit from this type of homepage header design — This the safest choice if you don’t know what to choose.

		A static image header with content gives you 4 essential elements that can effectively describe what your business is about, directly Above-The-Fold:

		1. Headline
		2. Supporting paragraph
		3. Call to action (what you want your visitors to do next)
		4. Supporting image

		The header image should play a supporting role rather than be the main focus. 
		It should display your headline, subparagraph and primary call to action along with an image that reinforces your business mission.

	C. SLIDESHOW HEADER WITH CONTENT

		To highlight several customer types you are targeting or various products / service offerings you offer
		Who should use this?

		A slideshow header works best for businesses that cater to a variety of customer types or have multiple core services or products.

		If your company has different solutions for numerous customer demographics, 
		a slideshow header allows the products / service offerings of your business to be showcased in an organized way.

		So if your business targets a few different groups of customer-base, or if you have a variety of product / service offerings, 
		then a slideshow based header might work well to target the numerous classes of customers, or to showcase the variety of your offerings.

	D. VIDEO BACKGROUND HEADER

	 	If  a video works well to tell the story of your brand. 
	 	See this detailed guide on how to the do’s and don’ts of setting up a video background on your website, including where to find videos or templates with video background built into them.
		Who should use this:

		A video background header works well to explain your business mission by featuring the scope your business process in an engaging way.

		Moving images or videos are very effective in grabbing people’s attention, 
		so it is no surprise a lot of successful websites use video backgrounds to improve the engagement levels and brand awareness.

		Most small businesses can benefit from video background headers when they are used correctly.

		Here are some tips to keep in mind if you decide to use a video background header design for your website:

		Use contextual video that carries a message – don’t pick random videos. 
		Pick videos that support your mission, message, or mood. 
		This especially effective if you are a lifestyle brand.
		Use a unique video rather than a stock video to give your website more personality and to create a connection with your audience.
		Use high-quality video that has high production value – don’t use videos that have low visual quality as it reflects poorly on your business.
		Keep the video short and video file below 6MB. 
		A large video file can drastically slow down your website’s loading speed.

3. Menu Bar Design

	Make sure it is easy to read – plain background color and plain fonts with contrasting color

	“The menu bar might not look important, but it actually impacts how your visitors perceive you and your brand.”

	Many people tend to send their focus in the wrong direction when choosing a website template. 
	The design is important, but the utility of the design trumps the esthetics every single time.

	One of the most undervalued elements of a website design is the menu bar design. 
	This includes the menu bar types, position, and layout.

	It’s important to choose one that fits your business’ needs.

	Why is menu bar design such an important part of your theme?

	The menu is the primary tool that your audience will use to navigate your website. 
	It creates a road map to guide your visitors around your website and where they should focus their attention.

	If a visitor visited your website and couldn’t figure out where to find the information they are looking for, 
	then your website basically failed miserably… no matter how good it looks!

	A. MENU BAR ~ DESIGN

		Do’s:

			1. DESIGN
				Choose a clean, simple design that makes your menu tabs easy to read and access.
			
			2. COLOR
				Use a color that’s easier on the eye as your menu background (nothing too sharp or flashy ).
				Highlight the menu tab text with a contrasting color to make them stand out. (See boxed section directly below if you’re not good with choosing colors.)
			
			3. HIERARCHY
				Create a hierarchy for your pages. 
				Layout your pages in decreasing importance from left to right (the most important pages goes to the left side).

		Don’ts:

			1. TABS
				Don’t clutter your menu with too many page tabs. 
				Only display pages that are essential to your business. 
				It’s easy to keep adding more pages as you’re passionate about your business. 
				But this may overwhelm your visitors.

			2. BACKGROUND
				Don’t use distracting backgrounds that make menu tabs hard to read. 
				Some people like to add fancy background images / patterns to menu bars. Don’t do that!
			
			3. FONT SIZE
				Don’t use small font sizes or overly fancy font designs that make it hard for your visitors to read. 
				It can be annoying!

	B. MENU BAR ~ POSITION

		B.1. Fixed Position Menu Bar // menu bar is permanently fixed at the top of the page

			if you have long scrolling pages. Easy for visitors to find the menu bar.

			This works best for websites with a lot of content (basically very long pages). 
			Fixing the menu bar to the top or side of the page allows your visitors 
			to quickly _switch between pages without the need to scroll back to the top. 

			If your website doesn’t have long pages (not content-heavy), 
			then having a fixed menu bar at the top of the page becomes less effective (and slightly pointless).  
			You’ll have more template design options at your disposal if you don’t use a fixed-position menu bar design.  
			Consider whether your website truly needs this feature.

		B.2. Top Horizontal Menu Bar 

			for website with limited menu bar items (less than 8 items) – most common position

			80% of websites use this traditional style of menu bar design.  
			It’s popular because it is effective.

			People are conditioned to go to the top of the page when they are looking for the menu bar.  
			The width of the menu bar is limited by the width of the browser.

			It’s a very classic menu bar design, and you can’t go wrong with this style most of the time.

		B.3. Side Vertical Menu Bar

			for graphic-intensive designs with a lot of menu bar items <---<<<

			Having a menu bar on the side is quite popular with graphic-intensive websites // such as a portfolio, restaurant, salon, spa, etc.

			Vertical menu bars are particularly effective if your website has a lot of menu tabs to display, 
			or have menu bar titles that are longer than usual. <---<<<

			Beware that some website templates have “fixed” vertical side menu bar, 
			so there is a limit to how many tabs you can add.  
			Some design templates have a scrollable vertical menu bar, so the number of tabs you can display is limitless.

		B.4. Bottom Horizontal Menu Bar

			For graphic-intensive designs where you want visitors to focus on content right away.
			This menu bar layout is not too common.  
			It works exceptionally well for graphic intensive websites where you want your visitors to focus on the immediate content, 
			instead of instinctively start searching for the menu bar.

			When the menu bar is placed at the bottom of the page, 
			it eliminates any visual distractions and forces your visitors to focus on the immediate content in front of them. 
			You will see this menu bar design in photography and portfolio websites (interior design, architecture, artists, and etc).

			This style of menu bar also works well if you place a lot of links in the content area to guide your visitors around the website.  
			This way, you are less reliant on the menu bar, as you guide your visitors to different pages with on-page links.

	C. LOGO POSITIONING

		1. Logo placed on the same level / line as your menu bar 

			less branding & allows more room for content
			This design works best for websites that place more focus on promoting their products or services, and less focused on business branding.  
			As the logo is on the same level or is contained within the menu bar, the size of the logo is limited.

			This is also a design that is mostly used by B2B (business-to-business) types of businesses where branding and marketing are less of a focus than retail businesses.

			Of course, the logo (branding) is still important, but just less pronounced as the size of the logo is limited by the menu bar.

		C.2. Logo placed in the center with the menu bar (either below or above it)

			more branding effect as logo is larger but reduces space for content

			If you are focused on creating a brand identity[!], this is the most effective design choice as your logo is more prominently displayed.

			There is less restriction on the size of your logo, so your visitors are more likely to pay attention to it.

			This logo layout is quite popular amongst retail businesses as they use various marketing techniques to create a brand identity and to promote brand loyalty.

			So think about how you want your logo to be positioned. Are you more focused on branding? 
			If so, placing your logo above or below your menu bar can help you accomplish that goal.
