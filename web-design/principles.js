# Grid systems

    rows and columns
    variations of them
    thousands of variations

    printed matter (books, newspapers and magazines)
    the way text and images are arranged in printed matter

    this way works
    must be in the web also

    grid systems
    prefabricated grid systems exist

# Visual Hierarchy

    directionality
    writing directions of the world
    more popular to less popular
    1. LTR (top-to-bottom) // left-to-right
    2. RTL (top-to-bottom) // right-to-left 
    3. TTB (RTL) // top-to-bottom
    4. both RTL & LTR
    5. both TTB & LTR

    reading patterns
    scanning axis
    shapes of F and Z
    the important elements 
        logo
        cta // call to action
        key image
        hero image
        thumbnail
    are placed along the scanning axis

    visual hierarchy
    what is it about?
    signalling to the reader
    the reading order
        what should be read first
        what should be read next
    Controlling the reading order

    strategies:
        page placements
        font size
        spacing
        direction
        typeface pairing
        color highlights

# Images and colors

    image and color placement
    main maxim: don`t overdo it

    colors 
        color palette: minimal
        - echo the branding of the host
        - serve to highlight the important areas (visual hierarchy)

        color pairing
        must be adequate
        due to color-blindness

    images

        images movement: minimal
        - avoid movement
        - a popular website keeps still

        image selection:
            - "I am using images just to fill up space"
                is easily detectable, like smiling on the phone
            images communicate useful information
                illustrate the accompanying text
                explain the product
            image sizes:
                web resolution 72 ppi
