catalina
Tomcat`s servlet container

Catalina implements Sun Microsystems`s specifications for JSP // servlet and JavaServer Pages
	In Tomcat, 
	a Realm element represents a "database" of usernames, passwords, and roles // similar to Unix groups
	assigned to those users. 
	Different implementations of Realm allow Catalina to be integrated 
	into environments where such authentication information is already being created and maintained, 
	and then use that information to implement Container Managed Security as described in the Servlet Specification.
