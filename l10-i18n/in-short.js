You have to localize in order to internationalize.
First localize then internationalize.
l10n is step 1, i18n is step 2.
l10n is planning, i18n is implementing.
l10n leads i18n.

the product MUST be internationalized
so that it can be localized.

i18n is the gun, l10n is the bullets.
A polyglot is a person who is i18nized from birth and can easily localize himself.

If you want to globalize your work
you need to internationalize your product
and continuously work on localizing it.

Going global!

A globalized enterprise 
has its products internationalized
and works continuously on l10n of their content.


Some data is locale-variable
Externalize them ALL! 

- external resource files

Netflix
g11n = export its services
i18n = add functionality to switch subtitles and audio
l10n = create subtitles and audio 

g11n = what your goal is
i18n = the technical part
l10n = content authors part

the process of i18n.

IKEA
i18n = no text, just pictures

2 options:
make it culturally-neutral
localize for every locale

a locale is a geographical location.

Data encoding:
	ASCII: bad, not enough.
	Unicode: good. 

You want to go global? You want g11n? 
Take these steps in their order:
1) i18n
2) l10n

The 2 processes:
	i18n and l10n

McDonalds has gone global
it embraced g11n
it exports to 100 countries
the 2 processes are happening in it.

Elements it has internationalized
	- menus
		localized for Israel (kosher)
		localized for China (spicy)
		localized for India (vegan)
	- work schedules
		localized for Israel (closed on special days)

Pixar has gone global
Elements it has internationalized:
	video 
		- localized the character reading motion ("Inside Out") for RTL countries (Israel, Arabsphere, Arab states)

Apple has gone global:
Elements it has internationalized:
	Siri-s 
		~ its language (language or language variant (AmE, GBE, AuE, NZE))
		~ conventions it uses in its speech
			- temperature scales - l10n: recalculation between F and C 
			- systems of measurements - l10n: recalculation between metric, imperial etc.

i18n = exportabilization, make X exportable.

Robot
Robot must be exported
It must be made exportable
in order to be exportable
it must be internationalized
an internationalized robot can adapt to locales it ships to
its speech is localized

C-3PO
is it internationalized?
partly.
its appearance it not localized.
its speech is localized.

i18n
Browsers
are internationalized
they are made to display all kinds of stuff 
no matter the locale

====
g11n is a strategy of planning
determined before the beginning of development 

if your planning did not include g11n
if your product already exists but is not globalized
it will have to be globalized retrospectively
this is harder to do.

You need the efforts from:
- copy writers, 
- designers
- web developers. 

g11n is the strategy
it includes the processes:
1. i18n
2. l10n

redesigning it with g11n in mind

E.g., a thermometer app that was internationalized
can easily switch between temperature scales

A calendar app that is internationalized
can easily switch between 
- languages (for weekdays)
- Sunday as first day or as last day

You globalize
by internationalizing your product 
and then localizing it for each locale

You internationalize once.
You localize continuously:
	for Mexico;
	for Quebec;
	for others.

1) build it with the necessary 



g11n takes open mindedness 
taking the world into consideration

Globalize:
how to adapt the product to people of other cultures

if project is not internationalized
it will have to be re-ingineered

Create a "message catalog"
i.e. a catalog of "messages" (strings)

Functionalities to internationalize:
--------------------------------------
	- date and time format
	- decimal separator (periods, commas)
	- currency
	- calendar
	- images and icons
	- enabling the use of Unicode
	- ensuring the proper handling of legacy character encodings where appropriate
	- avoiding dependance in code of user-interface string values, etc
	- identify locale (by url or by headers)
	- number formats
	- date and time formats, 
	- local calendars, 
	- number formats and numeral systems, 
	- sorting and presentation of lists, 
	- handling of personal names and forms of address, etc.
	- language switcher (in the header)
	- strings of text 
	- images with text on top
	- text expansion: layout to provide space when needed
	- make some elements culturally-neutral
	- DB update to provide for Unicode chars
	- text directionality
--------------------------------------


Elements of i18n
------------------------
	- abstracting all localizable components out of the source code and into files that you can hand over easily for l10n.
------------------------


Examples from commerce
------------------------
	- Amazon
	- Facebook
	- IKEA
	- McDonalds
	- Netflix
------------------------

Kinds of products:
	- software products
		BOTH form and content are switchable
	- hardware products
		only form is switchable

CX has to be re-engineered in the process of i18n


Concept
----------------------
	i18n is done once
	l10n is repeated for every locale (e.g. localize it for Mexico)
----------------------
