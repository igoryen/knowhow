	l10n
		________________
			"locale" = a specific target market
			a locale has requirements
				- language
				- cultural
				- etc

			Adaptation of A to the requirements of a locale = l10n (l10n)
				A locale can have its peculiarities in terms of
					+ culture
						- text and graphics containing references to objects, actions or ideas which, in a given culture, may be subject to misinterpretation or viewed as insensitive.
					+ law
						- Varying legal requirements
					+ input devices use
						- keyboard
					+ data 
						~ representation
							- number formats
							- date and time formats
							- currency formats
						~ manipulation
							- collation
							- sorting
					+ visuals
						- symbols
						- icons 
						- colors

					+ etc.		

				==================
				l10n can be defined as 
					the methodology of turning the websites or the software the way 
					which could endorse the features preferred by the localities.
					The components that are supposed to comply with the local features are 
						- language, 
						- design, 
						- date format, 
						- culture, 
						- and such things. 
					It is mainly practiced [for UX]
					to make the local users feel comfortable 
					about using web applications or the software.
				
					It plays a vital role 
					when any organization or business 
					intends to reach the local people for expanding their business in the local areas.
		
					For illustration, 
					let’s consider the very popular e-commerce website, Amazon. 
					In order to serve people in India, 
					they have made the option available for the users 
					to switch into the local language. 
					While at the festivals, 
					they use festive banners accordingly 
					to introduce sales and offers. 

					This is how the l10n is being done by the businesses 
					in order to expand their reach to the local people.


				==================			

				l10n is 
					the modification of a product or content 
					to the language or other specification of a particular locale. 
					The process of l10n involves 
					changing content to align to what obtains in the region of the target audience. 
					This can include 
						- converting currencies and units of measurement 
						- and changing the presentation of dates, phone numbers and addresses. 
					This could also mean 
						- changing the designation of a cultural group or country for political reasons; 
						for instance, 
							many residents of Taiwan will resent being referred to as “Chinese,” 
							preferring instead the appelation “Taiwanese.”

					l10n can also 
						- involve alterations to graphical content; 
							most images are of a culture-specific nature, 
							and therefore need to be slightly altered (or completely replaced) 
							in order to seem natural to the intended viewer. 
							The kind of clothing being worn by people in a stock photo, for instance, 
							can immediately tie the content to a specific region of the world. 
							Likewise, 
							a color with positive connotations in one culture 
							may carry negative connotations in a different one. 
							Symbols and icons are another graphical element 
							that are far from universal and may therefore require replacement.

					l10n also 
						involves certain aspects of language 
						that are not strictly covered by translation. 
						For instance, 
						idiomatic expressions and proverbs
						— if not omitted from the source material from the start — 
						will require replacement by a comparable one from the target destination, 
						assuming a suitable correlative actually exists.

					In summary, 
					l10n therefore aims to give a product the feeling 
					that it was produced solely for the target audience, 
					irrespective of culture and language.

				=======================
				l10n is 
					the transformation of content 
					to look and feel natural 
					to local users around the world. 
					Translation is part of the l10n process, 
					but it goes far beyond that in its efforts to appeal to the target market. 
					l10n may be 
						a combination of approaches
							—translating content, 
							tailoring your product line, 
							and setting up the systems, 
							such as accepting payments—
						that make marketing possible in a foreign market.

				====================
				l10n is 
					the process of adapting a product to meet 
						linguistic, 
						cultural, 
						legal, 
						date format 
						and other such 
					requirements of a particular locale or region. 
					l10n will help you 
					sell your product in a new area of the world, 
					with the desired “look and feel.”

					The process involves 
					- extracting all user-visible constituents of a product 
					- and adding locale-specific components along with text translation. 
					Successful l10n will help you 
					take your product to the global market, 
					without compromising on the quality.

				===============
				How’s l10n Done?

					Your “internationalized” product can be easily “localized.” 
					By adhering to i18n best practices while developing your product, 
					you should have your resource files (with locale-specific data) readily available 
					in externalized files and appropriate folders.

					Extract the resource files, 
					translate them (into every locale you wish to target), 
					merge into your code and 
					finally test your localized product. 

					You are now ready to sell the product in all these regions.


					Export Resource Files For Translation
						Depending on who you choose as your l10n partner, 
						you may have to export your resource files into a specific format for translation.

						Some companies support a variety of formats, 
						and you may be able to upload your files directly. 
						Other companies may ask for standard XLIFF (XML l10n Interchange File Format) files 
						or similar formats suitable for translation. 
						In such cases, 
						you can use tools to export your resource files into a format supported for l10n.

					Translate All Locale-Specific Data
						It is important that you work with a professional translator 
						who is a native language speaker, 
						familiar with local slang and modern usage of the language.

						You can work with translation companies 
						who specialize in l10n 
						and can assist you with smooth and hassle-free l10n.

						Review all translations for linguistic accuracy, 
						quality and other such requirements. 
						While developing your product, 
						you should follow i18n practices 
						that enforce adding comments for all strings. 
						This practice will make translations accurate and avoid errors.

					Merge Localized Data With Code And Test
						Import translated resource files into your application 
						and then merge them with your code. 
						Your application is now ready with new translations for all target locales.

						Finally, 
						test your product 
						to ensure functional and linguistic acceptance for all localized versions. 
						You should pay attention to 
						layout issues, 
						formatting errors, 
						display, 
						locale-specific settings, etc.

						Whenever you add or modify text in your source files, 
						you have to push them through the same l10n steps.


	=======================

	In order to define l10n, 
	we note again 
	that through i18n, 
	a product becomes adaptable to and user-friendly for audiences in different countries. 

	l10n, 
	conversely, 
	is the process of actually adapting that product 
	to specific target markets once i18n has taken place.

	As mentioned, 
	McDonald’s operates over 30,000 restaurants in 100 countries. 
	Its worldwide expansion is an example of g11n.
	By design, 
	the corporation creates a menu adaptable to various local tastes and customs. 
	This policy is an example of i18n.

	Many of the McDonald’s restaurants in Israel serve kosher food and drink 
	and close during the Sabbath and Jewish holidays. 

	McDonald’s has also opened a meat-free restaurant in India, 
	a country in which much of the population does not eat beef or pork. 
	In both cases, 
	McDonald’s has maintained its global brand identity 
	but tailored its products and services for local markets. 
	These cases exemplify l10n.

How Is l10n Different from Translation?

	A great deal of l10n, of course, has to do with language. 
	Translation and l10n are two intimately related concepts. 
	For most products, 
	l10n includes
	—but is not limited to—
	translation. 
	l10n requires consideration of multiple factors 
	that transcend the words a company uses 
	to describe or explain its product.

	When creating its film Inside Out, 
	for example, 
	Pixar modified its animation 
	to accommodate multiple versions of a scene 
	where a character points to and reads a sign. 
	In the Arabic version of the film, 
	the character motions from right to left, 
	rather than the left-to-right direction 
	the animation takes in the English version of the film.

	Here are just a few important considerations companies need to address when localizing a product:

	- Naming conventions (e.g., people from certain cultures may not have last names or may have multiple last names)
	- Telephone number formats
	- Date and time formats, such as DD/MM/YYYY and MM/DD/YYYY
	- Currency (symbol and amount)
	- Writing direction (left to right for most languages, but right to left in Hebrew and Arabic, and vertical in some Asian languages)
	- System of measurement, i.e., metric or imperial
	- Punctuation, such as quotation marks (“”) in English, low quotes („“) in German, and guillemets («») in French
	- Symbols and pictograms, e.g., check marks, stop signs, and the use of color to convey information
	- Electrical voltages, frequencies, and plugs
	- Legal requirements (such as the GDPR for the use of European Union citizens’ personal data)
	
	Apple’s Siri virtual assistant 
	represents a product that has been successfully localized. 
	When users ask Siri for the weather report or directions to a specific address, 
	Siri can provide the answer in Celsius or Fahrenheit, or kilometers or miles, respectively, 
	depending on the user’s location. 
	Users can even select their preferred accent for Siri’s voice 
	(in English, the choices include American, Australian, and South African).

	When building a website, 
	developers should have a robust website l10n strategy 
	by addressing these concerns during the planning and design phases. 
	Successful i18n precedes commensurately successful l10n.

	For example, 
	currencies such as the Chilean peso and the Japanese yen 
	do not use subunits in practice, 
	because each unit is so small 
	(one U.S. dollar is equal to roughly 700 Chilean pesos). 
	Therefore, 
	e-commerce websites that Japanese developers design for a Japanese audience can use only a single-integer variable.

	If the website expands to a U.S. audience, however, 
	the developers will need to add another variable to store both units and subunits (i.e. dollars and cents) 
	or convert the integer variable to a decimal. 
	This process can become both time-consuming and bug-prone 
	for highly complex code bases.

	l10n is the Final Step

	After a website has been fully internationalized 
	it then enters the process of l10n, 
	which is the step of actually translating it into a new language or languages. 
	Here is where all of the work you put into internationalizing pays off.
	l10n, 
	of course, 
	takes it a step or two further than simple, literal translation. 
	Especially important for marketing, 
	the localizing process ensures that text is not understandable in other languages 
	but also that the writing flows well and gets across the same message 
	no matter what language it’s in.

	Although it can take some time and trial and error, 
	l10n can be a smooth and relatively quick process 
	if i18n has been properly addressed.

	After a site has been both internationalized and localized, 
	it is then fully globalized. 
	Although the process can at first seem terribly complicated, 
	g11n is well within every business’s reach. 
	If you can find the right resources, 
	design your site for global audience and 
	take special care as you translate your online presence, 
	your business can take a step into this brave new world of possibilities.



==============================
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/i18n_and_l10n

l10n is the process of 
	adapting internationalized software 
	for a specific region or language 
	by translating text and adding locale-specific components. 
	l10n 
	(which is potentially performed multiple times, for different locales) 
	uses the infrastructure or flexibility provided by i18n 
	(which is ideally performed only once before l10n, 
	or as an integral part of ongoing development).


Translation is typically the most time-consuming component of language l10n.
This may involve:

	~ For film, video, and audio, 
	translation of spoken words or music lyrics, 
	often using either dubbing or subtitles

	~ Text translation for 
		printed materials, 
		digital media (possibly including error messages and documentation)

	~ Potentially altering 
		images and logos  
		containing text 
		to contain translations or generic icons

	~ Different translation length and 
	differences in character sizes 
	(e.g. between Latin alphabet letters and Chinese characters) 
	can cause layouts that work well in one language 
	to work poorly in others.

	~ Consideration of differences in dialect, register or variety
	~ Writing conventions like:
		- Formatting of numbers (especially decimal separator and digit grouping)
		- Date and time format, possibly including use of different calendars



Standard locale data
	Computer software can encounter differences 
	above and beyond straightforward translation of words and phrases, 
	because computer programs can generate content dynamically. 
	These differences may need to be taken into account 
	by the i18n process 
	in preparation for translation. 

	Many of these differences are so regular 
	that a conversion between languages can be easily automated. 

	The Common Locale Data Repository by Unicode 
	provides a collection of such differences. 
	Its data is used by major operating systems, 
	including Microsoft Windows, macOS and Debian, 
	and by major Internet companies or projects 
	such as Google and the Wikimedia Foundation. 

	Examples of such differences include:

	- Different "scripts" in different writing systems use different characters 
		– a different set of letters, syllograms, logograms, or symbols. 
		Modern systems use the Unicode standard 
		to represent many different languages 
		with a single character encoding.
	
	- Writing direction is left to right in most European languages, 
		right-to-left in Hebrew and Arabic, or both in boustrophedon scripts, 
		and optionally vertical in some Asian languages.


	- Complex text layout, 
		for languages where characters change shape depending on context
	
	- Capitalization 
		exists in some scripts and not in others
	
	- Different languages and writing systems 
		have different text sorting rules
	
	- Different languages have different numeral systems, 
		which might need to be supported if Western Arabic numerals are not used
	
	- Different languages have different pluralization rules, 
		which can complicate programs that dynamically display numerical content. 
		Other grammar rules might also vary, e.g. genitive.
	
	- Different languages use different punctuation 
		(e.g. quoting text using double-quotes (" ") as in English, 
			or guillemets (« ») as in French)
	
	- Keyboard shortcuts can only make use of buttons actually on the keyboard layout which is being localized for. 
		If a shortcut corresponds to a word in a particular language 
		(e.g. Ctrl-s stands for "save" in English), 
		it may need to be changed.


National conventions
	Different countries have different economic conventions, including variations in:

	- Paper sizes
	- Broadcast television systems and popular storage media
	- Telephone number formats
	- Postal address formats, postal codes, and choice of delivery services
	- Currency (symbols, positions of currency markers, and reasonable amounts due to different inflation histories) – ISO 4217 codes are often used for i18n
	- System of measurement
	- Battery sizes
	- Voltage and current standards
	
	E.g.
		In particular, 
		the United States and Europe differ in most of these cases. 
		Other areas often follow one of these.

	Specific third-party services, 
		such as 
		- online maps, 
		- weather reports, or 
		- payment service providers, 
	might not be available worldwide from the same carriers, or at all.

	Time zones vary across the world, 
	and this must be taken into account if a product originally only interacted with people in a single time zone. 
	For i18n, 
	UTC is often used internally and then converted into a local time zone for display purposes.

	Different countries have different legal requirements, meaning for example:

	| Regulatory compliance may require 
	| customization for a particular jurisdiction, 
	| or a change to the product as a whole, such as:
		- Privacy law compliance
		- Additional disclaimers on a web site or packaging
		- Different consumer labelling requirements
		- Compliance with export restrictions and regulations on encryption
		- Compliance with an Internet censorship regime or subpoena procedures
		- Requirements for accessibility
		- Collecting different taxes, such as sales tax, value added tax, or customs duties
		- Sensitivity to different political issues, like geographical naming disputes and disputed borders shown on maps (e.g., India has proposed a controversial bill that would make failing to show Kashmir and other areas as intended by the government a crime[12][13][14])
	
	| Government-assigned numbers have different formats 
	| (such as passports, Social Security Numbers and other national identification numbers)
	
	l10n also may take into account differences in culture, such as:

		- Local holidays
		- Personal name and title conventions
		- Aesthetics
		- Comprehensibility and cultural appropriateness of images and color symbolism
		- Ethnicity, clothing, and socioeconomic status of people and architecture of locations pictured
		- Local customs and conventions, such as social taboos, popular local religions, or superstitions such as blood types in Japanese culture vs. astrological signs in other cultures
