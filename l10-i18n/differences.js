	difference between l10n and i18n

	





Goals:
=====
	Sturdy systems architecture
	---------------------------
		When i18n is a fundamental strategy from the onset, 
		it guides crucial decision making, 
		such as picking a CMS 
		with tools to manage a variety of content streams 
		and making sure all your tools and software can talk to each other. 
		Not to mention, 
		i18n ensures that your product is sturdy and versatile 
		to facilitate diverse language formats. 
		Likewise, 
		l10n needs a platform 
		that is flexible and scalable enough 
		to host all of your stakeholders and indefinite growth. 
		The ideal scenario is 
		when these various systems 
		integrate seamlessly together 
		and management is largely automated.

	Flexible UI availability and database design
	--------------------------------------------
		A large part of initial i18n 
		is making sure you are prepared to handle all languages effectively. 
		Anticipate that 
		some language translations will take up much more space 
		than your source language does; 
		anticipate double-byte characters and RTL languages. 
		Be prepared to adapt your product to situations that are unfamiliar.

		Japanese users of a localized app, for example, 
		should be able to input their addresses in the unique Japanese format. 
		Russian users 
		expect to provide their patronymics with their contact information and 
		will notice if you do not ask for them. 
		Asking a Russian user for their patronymics is an aspect of l10n. 

		But i18n must first ensure 
		that the UI and database are set up to collect that unique information.

		i18n prepares your product 
		to be globally functional and relevant. 
		When l10n and translation take place, 
		they won’t break your interface or render it incoherent.

	Maximum efficiency
	------------------
		i18n lays the foundation 
		for certain critical capabilities, 
		often before you need them. 
		Planning ahead for l10n in the ways we’ve already talked about 
		can save serious time and money down the road. 
		If you skip the early steps, you may find, 
		in the rush to localize, that 
		your German translation is way too big to fit on the screen, 
		Japanese users have no way to input their correct addresses and actually make purchases, 
		and the UI cannot properly display Arabic characters. 
		Retrospective i18n is complicated and laborious. 
		The additional expenses and delays can very quickly add up.

		The need for i18n continues 
		as long as l10n does. 
		Hence, 
		you need a long-term approach 
		so that your teams are ready and able to work together 
		on i18n and l10n projects. 
		And it’s never too early to get started.

l10n vs i18n: Get the Best Outcome

	It’s good to break it down 
	so we can understand the next steps clearly. 
	But the reality is that l10n and i18n 
	are particularly complicated. 
	You must have a comprehensive understanding 
	of your markets around the world
	— at least, someone on your team needs to. 
	You need to be able to 
	- anticipate problems before they arise, 
	- adapt to cultural surprises, 
	- rely on sophisticated systems for automation. 
	
	We’re not just talking about a one-time translation. 
	Any updates will need to be rolled out across all of your localized products, 
	and the day will come when you’ll want to expand into even more foreign markets.

	You need a guide and a partner 
	on this journey full of twists and tongues. 
	i18n and l10n are your new frontier. 
	Make sure you’re always ready to say, “Yes,” to what lies ahead.



+++++	

	i18n refers to 
		design and development practices 
		to be adhered to 
		for easily adapting a product to multiple locales. 
		It means “preparing” your product for l10n. 

	l10n refers to 
		the actual process of adapting a product for a specific locale.

	Once your product goes through i18n, 
		you can perform l10n multiple times, 
		for various locales. 
		An internationalized product 
		can be easily localized, 
		without any errors and with minimal overhead.
