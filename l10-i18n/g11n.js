		g11n
		make it consumable by people everywhere on the planet
		-------------

			Competition 
			— both domestic and international — 
			has motivated many companies to begin exporting their products
			targeting global audiences; 
			for these companies then 
				it is imperative that their products 
				(especially in the case of interactive software and applications) 
				are compatible with their global consumers’ operating systems, 
				web browsers or other local specifications.

			For the most part 
			this process revolves around 
			the translation into the local language of any textual components 
			that the user is likely to interact with, 
			including menus, toolbars and dialogue boxes. 
			g11n also involves the various ways in which onscreen text is to be sorted or displayed.

			Because this process is mostly linguistic, 
			it makes little sense 
			to recreate applications from scratch 
			every time they need to be prepared for a specific market. 
			Instead, 
			the application to be globalized 
			should >>initially<< be coded in such a way 
			that text can easily be replaced 
			without affecting its underlying (non-textual) components.

			g11n is therefore a process 
			that is used to address the challenges of logistics 
			that an organization faces 
			when it expands its content and assets into new markets 
			with different perspectives and cultural beliefs.

			The processes involved in g11n include 
			- carrying out research and identifying global markets, 
			- validating and selecting these markets, 
			- formalizing global business requirements, 
			- translating into the target audience language 
			- and putting their culture into consideration 
				while aligning it and getting support for internalization.

			=====================
			g11n - The Common Goal Of i18n And l10n
				l10n and i18n have a common goal - g11n. 
				g11n is the process of developing and marketing 
				multilingual products 
				to people from across the globe.
				(aka exporting products, producing products for export)

				If you are developing 
				- a software application or 
				- a website or a mobile app, 
				and if you intend to make it available in multiple locales (or regions), 
				you are trying to “globalize” your product. 
				i18n and l10n will help you achieve this goal - g11n.

				Multi-lingual, Multi-cultural and Formatting Requirements
				.................................
					Your multilingual audience is also inherently multicultural. 
					Diversity doesn’t confine to languages and cultural sensitivities alone. 
					Different parts of the world follow 
					different formats for 
					- date and time, 
					- decimal separators, 
					- currency, 
					- calendar months, etc. 
					e.g.
					-----------------
						Consider the following examples:

						In Germany, 
						they use “,” as decimal separators and “.” as thousand separators. 
						For example, 
						the number 23.240 reads as Twenty-three thousand, two hundred and forty.

						The Gregorian months are not the only official calendar months across the globe. 
						There are few countries following different official calendars. 
						For example, 
						the Hijri Calendar is the official calendar in Saudi Arabia.
					-----------------

					The images and icons used in your product 
					should also be sensitive to your multicultural audience. 
					--------------
						Dragons may hold negative connotations in the West, 
						but in the East, they have positive connotations.
					--------------
					“g11n is a daunting task! 
					However, it doesn’t have to be 
					if you understand and follow best practices for i18n 
					and then implement l10n.”

	If you’re looking for a clear, universally agreed-upon definition of g11n, 
	you’ll probably be looking for a while. 
	The term “g11n” refers to 
	any activity 
	that brings the people, cultures, and economies of different countries 
	closer together.

	In commerce (aka business), however, 
	“g11n” 
	(sometimes also called “going global”) 
	refers to a series of practices 
	by which organizations become more tightly connected 
	with their customers and partners around the world.

	g11n: A Few Examples

		Still a bit too vague for you? 
		A few examples of g11n in the world of commerce (business):

		#1. Online marketplaces like eBay and Amazon 
		make it easy to buy products from enterpsises (aka businesses) or individuals 
		on the other side of the planet. 

		Even products sold in traditional brick-and-mortar stores 
		like Target 
		often make stops in several different countries 
		before reaching their final destinations. 
		Consumer electronics, for example, 
		are commonly sourced 
		from raw materials in India, made in China, then sold in America.
	
		Many large restaurant chains, 
		like McDonald’s, 
		operate in dozens of countries. 
		McDonald’s specifically has franchises in upwards of one hundred countries, 
		and diners around the world recognize its brand and logo.
		
		Netflix operates in more than 190 countries 
		and customizes content offerings for individual markets 
		with subtitles and programming in local languages.
	
		The instantly recognizable “swoosh” logo of Nike 
		transcends different cultures and languages. 
		Nike has formed partnerships with athletes 
		who play a variety of sports in many different countries 
		and uses these endorsements to support its worldwide expansion.
		
		As a general rule, 
		the term “g11n” in commerce 
		refers to any process or activity 
		related to operating in different national markets, 
		from product design to marketing.

		There are many benefits of g11n 
		for both companies and consumers. 
		The impact of global inter-connectivity 
		has been a boon for the world economy in recent decades 
		and has increased the world’s GDP 
		from $50 trillion in 2000 
		to $75 trillion in 2016. 
		g11n has come hand-in-hand 
		with the most transformational advances of the 20th century, 
		such as international air travel and the Internet.

		The terms l10n and i18n 
		both fall under the banner of g11n. 

		============
		through i18n, 
		a product becomes adaptable to and user-friendly 
		for audiences in different countries. 
		===================
		https://www.lionbridge.com/blog/translation-l10n/l10n-g11n-i18n-whats-the-difference/
		g11n, 
		something of an umbrella term, 
		encompasses both i18n and l10n. 
		It refers to the process 
		by which different pieces of the global economy 
		are becoming connected, 
		and the process by which companies bring their business to the rest of the world.

		When exporting its commodities
		the commodities must be ..-ized

	g11n is a Strategy

	When those in business development and strategy 
	talk about g11n, 
	they’re looking at the bigger picture. 
	g11n is the end goal for those designing an application or website 
	for a worldwide audience.

	A fully globalized app or website 
	is fully available and functional in multiple languages. 
	And given the pervasiveness of the web and apps in every aspect of our lives, 
	a robust g11n strategy is vital for any business today.

	But the full translation of a site or app into many languages doesn’t just happen. 
	It’s a complicated procedure 
	requiring the combined efforts of 
	- copy writers, 
	- designers and 
	- web developers. 
	To reach the goal of full g11n, 
	business strategists have to consider 
	two other smaller processes within g11n. 
	The last of those steps is l10n, 
	but first comes i18n.
