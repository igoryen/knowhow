popup dialogs
the height and width are set in the style attribute
Hypo1: the style values come from an angularJS file.
	Where is that file?
	Step 1: Find in folder: "style".
	Step 2: Find in folder: "adverse" // part of the modal's id
		Found the string in dialog.js
		It sets: 
		width: 800,
		Hypo1: dialog.js is the file I need.
		Action: editing (adding properties, editing property names).
		Outcome: takes no effect.
		Hypo1 must be wrong.

	Intent: Cross file search for "adverse".
	Finding: No other file but dialog.js.

	Intent: return to dialog.js.

	Idea: test the sensitivity by breaking the function (commenting out some code).
	I do: the above, Eclipse refresh, page reload.
	Result: no changes.

	Hypo: Eclipse server restart is needed.
	I do: server restart, page reload.
	Result: took effect!
		width: changed from 800px to 300px.
		Wonder: why 300? Where is that set?
