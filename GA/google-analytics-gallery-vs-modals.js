track the click on the youtube video play button not possible

its an iframe, separate DOM
wil and iain both should know that

T: 
the gallery is my project
its written totally differently
it uses the youtube API
to track video plays

the youtube video modal
doesn’t have that functionality

Me:
ok, it’s a recent project?

T:
a year ago?
point is, theres no budget for the YT modal to use the YT API
ive brought it up with wil multiple times
