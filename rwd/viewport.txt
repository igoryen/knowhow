The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.

The viewport varies with the device.
The viewport is small on a mobile phone.
The viewport is large on a computer screen.

the web page is too large for the phone's viewport.
the browser on the phone scales down the web page to fit it to the screen.

Need: to take control of the viewports.

Solution: tag <meta> (HTML5)

1) tell the Webbrowser how to control the dimensions and scaling of the web page.
2) set the width of the web page to follow screen-width of the device (a variable thing).
3) set the initial zoom level when the page is firt loaded by the device's browser.
