WordPress comes with a URMS
user role management system 

URMS defines what a specific user can and cannot do on your website. 
Knowing these user roles and permissions are essential as your WordPress site grows. 

Out of the box when you install WordPress, there are five default user roles:

- Administrator
	same as the super-user
- Editor
	can't do back-end
- Author
	edit and update pages
- Contributor
- Subscriber
