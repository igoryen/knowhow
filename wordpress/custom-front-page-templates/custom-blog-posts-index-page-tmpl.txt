Custom Blog Posts Index Page Template

To create a custom blog posts index template, 
include the following in the Theme:

home.php

Use only the home.php template file 
for the blog posts index. 

Do not use a Custom Page Template (such as template-blog.php) for two reasons:

When the static front page feature is configured properly, 
WordPress will not use a Custom Page Template to display the blog posts index, 
even if a Custom Page Template is assigned to the page designated as the "Posts page". WordPress will only use either home.php or index.php.
When the Custom Page Template is assigned to a static page other than the one designated as the "Posts page," the blog posts index loop pagination will not work properly.
