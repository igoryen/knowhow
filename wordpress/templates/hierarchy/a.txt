Template Hierarchy

As discussed, 
template files are modular, reusable files, 
used to generate the web pages 
on your WordPress site. 

Some template files 
(such as the header and footer template) 
are used on all of your siteâ€™s pages, 
while others 
are used only under specific conditions.

This article explains how WordPress determines which template file(s) to use on individual pages. 
If you want to customize an existing WordPress theme 
it will help you decide which template file needs to be edited.

Tip: 
You can also use Conditional Tags 
to control which templates are loaded on a specific page.
