Examples 

If your blog is at 
	http://example.com/blog/ 
and a visitor clicks on a link to a category page 
such as 
	http://example.com/blog/category/your-cat/, 

WordPress looks for a template file 
in the current theme’s directory 
that matches the category’s ID 
to generate the correct page. 

More specifically, WordPress follows this procedure:

# Looks for a template file in the current theme’s directory 
	that matches the category’s slug. 
	If the category slug is “unicorns,” 
		http://example.com/blog/category/unicorns/ 
	then WordPress looks for a template file named 
		category-unicorns.php.

# If category-unicorns.php is missing 
	and the category’s ID is 4, 
	WordPress looks for a template file named category-4.php.

# If category-4.php is missing, 
	WordPress will look for a generic category template file, 
	category.php.

# If category.php does not exist, 
	WordPress will look for a generic archive template, 
	archive.php.

# If archive.php is also missing, 
	WordPress will fall back to the main theme template file, 
	index.php.
