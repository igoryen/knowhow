Front Page display

The front-page.php template file 
is used to render your site’s front page, 
whether the front page displays the blog posts index (mentioned above) or a static page. 

The front page template takes precedence over the blog posts index (home.php) template. 
If the front-page.php file does not exist, 
WordPress will either use the home.php or page.php files 
depending on the setup in Settings → Reading. 

If neither of those files exist, it will use the index.php file.

front-page.php – 
	Used for both “your latest posts” or “a static page” 
	as set in the front page displays section of Settings → Reading.

home.php – 
	If WordPress cannot find front-page.php 
	and “your latest posts” is set in the "front page displays" section, 
	it will look for home.php. 
	Additionally, 
	WordPress will look for this file 
	when the posts page is set in the "front page displays" section.

page.php – 
	When “front page” is set in the front page displays section.

index.php – 
	When “your latest posts” is set in the "front page displays" section 
	but home.php does not exist 
	or when front page is set 
	but page.php does not exist.

As you can see, 
there are a lot of rules to what path WordPress takes. 
Using the chart above is the best way to determine what WordPress will display.
