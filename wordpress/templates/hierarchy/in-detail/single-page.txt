Single Page 

The template file used to render a static page ("page" post-type). 
Note that unlike other post-types, 
"page" is special to WordPress and uses the following path:

custom template file – 
	The "page template" assigned to the page. See get_page_templates().

page-{slug}.php – 
	If the page slug is "recent-news", 
	WordPress will look to use "page-recent-news.php".

page-{id}.php – 
	If the page ID is 6, 
	WordPress will look to use "page-6.php".
