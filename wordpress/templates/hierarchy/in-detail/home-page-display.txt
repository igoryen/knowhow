Home Page display 

By default, 
WordPress sets your siteâ€™s home page 
to display your latest blog posts. 

This page is called the "blog posts index". 
You can also set your blog posts to display on a separate static page. 

The template file home.php is used 
to render the blog posts index, 
whether it is being used as the front page 
or on separate static page. 

If home.php does not exist, 
WordPress will use index.php.

home.php
index.php

Note: 
If front-page.php exists, 
it will override the home.php template.
