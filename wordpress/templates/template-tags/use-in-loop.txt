Using Template Tags Within the Loop 

Many template tags work within the WordPress Loop. 
This means that they are included in the template files 
as part of the php “loop” that generates the pages users see 
based upon the instructions inside of the loop.

The WordPress loop begins with:

if ( have_posts() ) : 
    while ( have_posts() ) : 
        the_post(); 

Template tags that work within the loop 
must be in the middle area, 
before the ending section of the loop below:

    endwhile; 
else :
    _e( 'Sorry, no posts matched your criteria.', 'devhub' );
endif;


Some of template tags that need to be inside of the loop include

	the_content()
	the_excerpt()
	next_post()
	previous_post()


The main reason why some functions require the loop 
is because they require the global post object to be set.

If the template tag you want to use doesn’t have to be within the loop

	wp_list_cats()
	wp_list_pages()

then you can put it in any file you’d like, 
for instance in the sidebar, header, or footer template files.

These are functions that typically do not require the global post object.
