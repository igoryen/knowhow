How to Use Template Tags 

Using template tags is very simple. 
In any template file 
you can use a template tag 
by simply printing one line of php code to call the template tag. 

Printing the header.php file is as simple as:

get_header();






Parameters 

Some template tags let you pass parameters. 
Parameters are extra pieces of information 
that determine what is retrieved from the database.

For example, 
the bloginfo() template tag 
allows you to give it a parameter telling WordPress the specific piece of information you want. 
To print the blog name, 
you just pass along the parameter “name,” like so:


bloginfo( 'name' );

To print the version of WordPress that the blog is running on, 
you would pass a parameter of “version”:

bloginfo( 'version' );

For each template tag, the parameters differ. 
A list of the parameters and what they can do can be found 
on specific template tag pages located throughout the code reference.
