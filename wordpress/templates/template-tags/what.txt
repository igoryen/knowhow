What is a Template Tag? 

A template tag is simply a piece of code 
that tells WordPress to get something from the database. 

It is broken up into three components:

	A PHP code tag
	A WordPress function
	Optional parameters

You can use a template tag to call another theme file or some information from the database.

For example, 
the template tag get_header() 
tells WordPress to get the header.php file 
and include it in the current theme file. 

Similarly, 
get_footer() 
tells WordPress to get the footer.php file.

There are also other kinds of template tags:

the_title() – 
	tells WordPress to 
	get the title of the page or post from the database 
	and include it.

bloginfo( 'name' ) – 
	tells WordPress to 
	get the blog title out of the database 
	and include it in the template file.

If you look closely at the last example, 
you will also see that there is a parameter between the parenthesis. 

Parameters let you do two things:

	ask for specific pieces of information and
	format the information in a certain way.

Parameters are covered extensively below, 
but it’s useful to be aware that you can send WordPress-specific instructions 
for how you want the data presented.
