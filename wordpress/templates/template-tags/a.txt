Template tags 
are used within themes 
to retrieve content from your database. 
The content could be anything 
from a blog title 
to a complete sidebar. 

Template tags are the preferred method 
to pull content into your theme because:

they can print dynamic content;
they can be used in multiple theme files; and
they separate the theme into smaller, more understandable, sections.
