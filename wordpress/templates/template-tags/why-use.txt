Why Use Template Tags 

By encapsulating all of the code for a particular chunk of content, 
template tags make it very easy 
to include various pieces of a template 
in a theme file 
and also to maintain the theme.

It is far easier to create one header.php file 
and have all of your theme templates like 
	single.php, 
	page.php, 
	front-page.php, 
	etc. 
reference that one theme file using get_header() 
than copying and pasting the code into each theme file. 

It also makes maintenance easier. 
Whenever you make a change in your header.php file, 
the change is automatically carried over into all of your other theme files.

Another reason to use template tags is 
to display dynamic data, i.e. data from the database. 
In your header, 
you could manually include the title tag, like so:

<title>My Personal Website</title>

However, 
doing this means manually editing your theme any time you want to change the title of your website. 
Instead, itâ€™s easier to include the bloginfo( 'name' ) template tag, 
which automatically fetch the site title from the database. 
Now, you can change the title of your site in WordPress, 
rather than having to hard code your theme templates.
