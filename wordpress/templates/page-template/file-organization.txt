File Organization of Page Templates 

As discussed in Organizing Theme Files, 
WordPress recognizes the subfolder "page-templates". 
Therefore, 
it’s a good idea to store your global page templates in this folder 
to help keep them organized.

Alert: 
A specialized page template file 
(those created for only one time use) 
cannot be in a sub-folder, 
nor, if using a Child Theme, 
in the Parent Theme’s folder.
