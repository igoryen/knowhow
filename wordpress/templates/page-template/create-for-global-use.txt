Creating Custom Page Templates for Global Use

Sometimes you’ll want a template 
that can be used globally by any page, or by multiple pages.  
Some developers will group their templates with a filename prefix, 
such as page_two-columns.php

Alert:  
Important! 
Do not use "page-" as a prefix, 
as WordPress will interpret the file as a specialized template, 
meant to apply to only one page on your site.

For information on theme file-naming conventions and filenames you cannot use, 
see reserved theme filenames.

Tip: 
A quick, safe method for creating a new page template 
is to make a copy of page.php 
and give the new file a distinct filename. 
That way, 
you start off with the HTML structure of your other pages 
and you can edit the new file as needed.

To create a global template, 
write an opening PHP comment at the top of the file 
that states the template’s name.


<?php /* Template Name: Example Template */ ?>
 

It’s a good idea to choose a name that describes what the template does 
as the name is visible to WordPress users 
when they are editing the page. 
For example, 
you could name your template 
Homepage, Blog, or Portfolio.

This example from the TwentyFourteen theme 
creates a page template called Full Width Page:

<?php
/**
 * Template Name: Full Width Page
 *
 * @package WordPress
 * @subpackage Twenty_Fourteen
 * @since Twenty Fourteen 1.0
 */


once you upload the file to your theme’s folder (e.g., page-templates), 
go to the Page > Edit screen 
in your admin dashboard.

On the right hand side 
under "attributes" 
you’ll see "template".  
This is where users are able 
to access your global page templates.

The select list has a maximum width of 250px, so longer names may be cut off.
