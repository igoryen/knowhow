Page templates are a specific type of template file that can be applied to a specific page or groups of pages.

Since a page template is a specific type of template file, here are some distinguishing features of page templates:

Page templates are used to change the look and feel of a page.
A page template can be applied to a single page, a page section, or a class of pages.

Page templates generally have a high level of specificity, 
targeting an individual page or group of pages. 
For example, 
a page template named page-about.php is more specific than the template files page.php or index.php 
as it will only affect a page with the slug of “about.”

If a page template has a template name, 
WordPress users editing the page have control over what template will be used to render the page.
