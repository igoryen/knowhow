Creating a Custom Page Template for One Specific Page 

As mentioned in the Template Hierarchy page, 
you can create a template for a specific page.  

To create a template for one specific page, 
copy your existing page.php file 
and rename it with your page’s slug or ID:

page-{slug}.php
page-{ID}.php

For example: 
Your About page has a slug of ‘about’ and an ID of 6. 
If your active theme’s folder has a file named "page-about.php" or "page-6.php", 
then WordPress will automatically find and use that file 
to render the About page.

To be used, 
specialized page templates 
must be in your theme’s folder 
(i.e. /wp-content/themes/my-theme-name/ ).
