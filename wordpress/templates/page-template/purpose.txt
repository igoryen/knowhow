Page Templates Purpose & User Control 

If you plan on making a custom page template for your theme, 
you should decide a couple of things before proceeding:

Whether the page template will be for one specific page or for any page; 
and
What type of user control you want available for the template.

Every page template that has a template name 
can be selected by a user 
when they create or edit a page. 
The list of available templates can be found at 
Pages > Add New > Attributes > Template. 

Therefore, a WordPress user can choose any page template with a template name, 
which might not be your intention.

For example, 
if you want to have a specific template for your “About” page, 
it might not be appropriate to name that page template “About Template” 
as it would be globally available to all pages (i.e. the user could apply it to any page). 

Instead, 
create a single use template 
and WordPress will render the page with the appropriate template, 
whenever a user visits the “About” page.

Conversely, 
many themes include the ability to choose 
how many columns a page will have. 

Each of these options is a page template 
that is available globally. 
To give your WordPress users this global option, 
you will need to create page templates for each option 
and give each a template name.

Dictating 
whether a template is for global use vs. singular use 
is achieved by the way the file is named 
and whether or not is has a specific comment.

Note: 
Sometimes it is appropriate to have a template globally available 
even if it appears to be a single use case. 
When you’re creating themes for release, 
it can be hard to predict what a user will name their pages. 
Portfolio pages are a great example 
as not every WordPress user will name their portfolio the same thing 
or have the same page ID 
and yet they may want to use that template.
