Uses for Page Templates #Uses for Page Templates

Page templates display your siteâ€™s dynamic content on a page, 
e.g., posts, news updates, calendar events, media files, etc. 

You may decide that you want your homepage to look a specific way, 
that is quite different to other parts of your site. 

Or, you may want to display a featured image 
that links to a post on one part of the page, 
have a list of latest posts elsewhere, and use a custom navigation. 
You can use page templates to achieve these things.

This section shows you how to build page templates that can be selected by your users through their admin screens.

For example, you can build page templates for:

full-width, one-column
two-column with a sidebar on the right
two-column with a sidebar on the left
three-column
