flex-basis

This defines the default size of an element 
before the remaining space is distributed. 
It can be 
	a length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or 
	a keyword. 

The "auto" keyword means "look at my width or height property" 
(which was temporarily done by the "main-size" keyword until deprecated). 
The "content" keyword means "size it based on the item's content" - 
this keyword isn`t well supported yet, 
so it`s hard to test and harder to know what its brethren "max-content", "min-content", and "fit-content" do.

.item {
  flex-basis: <length> | auto; /* default auto */
}

If set to 0, 
the extra space around content isn`t factored in. 
If set to "auto", 
the extra space is distributed based on its "flex-grow" value.
