Paste and Indent handles this scenario correctly, calculating the appropriate amount of indentation
for first line of the pasted code.

To perform a Paste and Indent:

Editing Text 2

1. Copy the desired lines of code to the clipboard.
2. Position the cursor at the correct indentation level.
3. "Edit" > "Paste and Indent"

Or press 
    Shift+Command+V on Mac OS X or 
    Ctrl+Shift+V on Windows and Linux.

You can remap the default Paste shortcut to perform a Paste and Indent, which should
always do the right thing. Refer to the Key Bindings section for a how-to.
